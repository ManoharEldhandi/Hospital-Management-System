Project Overview

The Hospital Management System is a console-based Java application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for handling various administrative tasks, ensuring efficient and organized management of a healthcare facility.

Features

The application is divided into six key modules:
	1.	Patient Management
	•	Register new patients with details like name, age, and gender.
	•	View a list of all registered patients.
	2.	Appointment Management
	•	Book appointments with details such as patient name, doctor name, and appointment date.
	•	View all scheduled appointments.
	3.	Electronic Health Records (EHR)
	•	Maintain patient health records, including diagnosis and treatment details.
	•	View detailed health records for patients.
	4.	Billing Management
	•	Create bills for patients with details like patient name and bill amount.
	•	View all generated bills.
	5.	Inventory Management
	•	Add and manage medical supplies with details like item name, quantity, and supplier information.
	•	View the inventory list and check stock levels.
	6.	Staff Management
	•	Register staff members with details such as name, position, and contact information.
	•	View a list of all staff members.

Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Java
	•	Data Storage: Temporary in-memory storage using ArrayList.
	•	Execution: Console-based application for simplified interaction.

Key Highlights
	•	Modular Design: The application is structured into distinct modules, ensuring better code organization and maintainability.
	•	Scalable Architecture: Designed with a modular approach to facilitate future enhancements and integrations.
	•	Ease of Use: User-friendly menus and straightforward inputs for smooth interaction.

Limitations
	•	Data Persistence: Currently, the application does not include persistent data storage. Data exists only for the duration of the program’s execution.
	•	Basic Features: Advanced functionalities like multi-user access, database integration, and security measures are not implemented.

Future Enhancements
	•	Integration with databases for persistent data storage.
	•	Implementation of authentication and user role-based access.
	•	Development of a GUI-based interface for enhanced usability.
	•	Additional features like insurance processing, tax calculation, and automated notifications.
